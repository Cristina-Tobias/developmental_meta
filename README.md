# A systematic review of short-term and working memory abilities in children with intellectual disability; to what extent do the result support the delay or difference hypotheses?

## Aim

The aim of the study is to investigate if short-term and working memory abilities exhibit a developmentally delayed or developmentally different pattern in children with ID.  This will be done by an overall analysis and subgroup analyses based on type of memory (short-term or working memory), aetiology of ID (familial or organic). In addition, the overall analysis will also be repeated with level of IQ as a moderator. 

### Research questions

1. Do short-term and working memory abilities exhibit a developmentally delayed or developmentally different pattern in children with ID (compared to mental age matched groups)? 
1.1 Is this pattern moderated by origin of ID (familial and organic) or level of IQ?
2. Do origin (familial and organic) of ID or level of IQ moderate whether STM and WM performance are delayed or different?

### Hypotheses

1. The STM delay hypothesis will be supported if STM performance of participants with ID will not differ significantly from that of the mental age-matched group 

2. The WM delay hypothesis will be supported if WM performance of participants with ID will not differ significantly from that of the mental age-matched group 

3. The STM difference hypothesis will be supported if STM performance of participants with ID will differ significantly from that of the mental age-matched group. We expect that the difference may occur in any direction. 

4. The WM difference hypothesis will be supported if WM performance of participants with ID will differ significantly from that of the mental age-matched group. We expect that the difference may occur in any direction. 

## Methods

We conducted and reported this systematic review according to NIRO-SR guidelines for conducting and reporting systematic reviews of non-intervention research (REF).
